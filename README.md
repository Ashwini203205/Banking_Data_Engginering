# Banking-Analytics-DE
# 🏦 Banking Analytics Data Engineering Pipeline

> End-to-End Data Engineering Project using PySpark, PostgreSQL, Docker, Apache Airflow, and Power BI

---

# 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **Data Engineering Pipeline** built using industry-standard tools and best practices.

The pipeline ingests raw banking customer data, processes it through the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold)**, stores the transformed data in PostgreSQL, automates the workflow using Apache Airflow, containerizes the application with Docker, and visualizes business insights using Power BI.

# 🔄 ETL Pipeline

## Step 1 – Data Source

- Bank Marketing Dataset (CSV)
- 45,211 customer records

---

## Step 2 – Bronze Layer

Purpose:

- Store raw data
- No modifications
- Preserve original records

Output Table

```
bronze.customer_raw
```

---

## Step 3 – Silver Layer

Data Cleaning Performed

- Remove duplicates
- Handle null values
- Trim spaces
- Standardize text
- Convert data types
- Validate records

Output Table

```
silver.customer_clean
```

---

## Step 4 – Gold Layer

Business transformation tables created:

| Table | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| customer_summary | Overall KPIs |
| deposit_summary | Deposit Subscription Summary |
| job_summary | Customers by Job |
| education_summary | Customers by Education |
| marital_summary | Customers by Marital Status |
| month_summary | Monthly Subscription Analysis |
